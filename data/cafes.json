They actually failed to deliver my lunch all together. I don't know if the order wasn't put in, or the kitchen didn't get on it, or what. I waited patiently and read one if the magazines they had splay out on the tables (which is cool) but after a few articles, I realized that 23 minutes had lapsed. I heard some murmuring by the young lady that took my order that\" this guy didn't get his burrito\" at which point I was approaching the counter. I explained to her that I had to go. She was very apologetic but it was too late. My lunch break was gone. Unfed. \nOut of the corner of my eye I observed what seemed to be a lack of direction\/ or leadership of the crew. Everyone seemed to be doing a bit if this and that with no clear position. I didn't see anyone commanding, preparing,or expediting. I also heard some murmuring from other customers about the wait time. I got there around 1115 and it wasn't terribly busy. I would suggest some sort of crew briefing before the start of a shift ( especially the beginning of a rush). If you taking orders and ringing out, stay there. Running the grill- get on it, expediting the plates? Etc. I know everyone has off days, and i'm sure my case was rare.

Side of bacon, very small slices, was skimpy and expensive for two pieces.  Eggs benedict was good, but seemed to be missing something.  Hash brown potatoes were very good.

{"id":"2rzPCyXPSVMvE_BQeuqlSQ","text":"On my latest visit, I actually came to try the dinner menu. I went there during the time they had a special called \"The Early Show.\" Most of us probably don't eat at a restaurant between 4 and 6 p.m. Monday through Friday (that's when Early Show special kicks in) but for some odd reason I lucked out and was hungry then. \n\nSo the special is pretty much a proper complete dinner meal. First course: soup or salad (go with the soup, at least you have eight choices to choose from). Second course: pick one of four select entrees (I choose the chicken marsala). Final course: pick one of the two desserts (I ordered tiramisu). Wow, all of the food was really delicious and is indeed worth five stars. In fact, I liked my food so much that I signed up on their e-mail list so I could (hopefully) get some discounts in the future.\n\nHowever, I'm sticking with my four-star rating. Why? Unfortunately, when I was there, the service was REALLY slow. Yes, they give you warm bread and butter while you wait, but it seems like there aren't many servers inside. In fact, I saw only two servers for about 10 different tables! So basically I had to follow up at times as to what happened to my order (disclosure: I was waiting for my free birthday ice cream dessert \"to go,\" which took about 20 minutes to make. That's a little too long for an ice cream in my opinion).\n\nOverall, the food is delicious and definitely worth the visit. If you are looking for a deal, go there between 4 and 6 p.m. on the weekdays.

Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations, the prices were way too high for comfort and the dining selection didn't excite me. \n\nWhile I'm not a vegan, I definitely enjoy trying vegan dishes and often like them better than the less healthy versions. My mom is a vegan, however, and strongly prefers Organic whenever possible. Upon arrival there was only one other guest there, yet the wait staff still took an unusual amount of time to come over to us. When she finally did, we asked how much of their selection was Organic, and she just kept saying they get all their produce from the locals farmers' market and it's often very natural or Organic. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love that they do the local farm-to-table concept, but if someone is seriously inquiring about Organic I wouldn't suggest saying the downgraded synonyms, \"natural\" or \"fresh\" as it insinuates it is probably not certified Organic. On the topic of local, though, they had a nice selection of wines and beers from local businesses, including beers from Draughtsmen, Captain Fatty's, The Apiary and Telegraph. The drink prices were noticeably higher than other taprooms and bottle shops in town, I tend to visit, with their prize drink, \"The Sunshine Spritz,\" being the most affordable at $10 a glass. \n\nFor lunch we had the vegan Mac N Cheese and the Bahn Mi. The Mac was very decadent and heavy, I could only have a couple bites before I was over it. It'd would work nicely as a side to something else but wouldn't suggest as a meal. The Bahn Mi was very spicy, be fair warned, and honestly just did not taste great. After the first bite I didn't want to finish it but I was very hungry (and it was expensive) so I ate it anyways. I've had really good Bahn Mi before but this one was just too acidic and lacked variety of texture and flavor. The best part was the bread, which is very out of character for me as I'm not a huge bread person. \n\nWe definitely enjoyed sitting at the open-air bar, people watching on State St and breathing in the crisp Spring breeze. The interior was beautiful and the space theme, super retro. The staff were kind but slow considering the lack of crowd, and didn't feel genuine. When\/If you visit, there's ticketed free parking for and hour+ in the lot right behind the building. They have a restroom inside, bar seating, patio seating, and room for small to medium groups. The space gets 4 stars for appearance but the overall experience sits at 3.

Here's the story: It was \"late\" (8:30pm) on a Wednesday and I'd just gotten out of a class at Wash U across the street and just wanted, my then fvroite sandwich - the Yukon, to go. And they said \"no to-go anymore\". I was shocked.

Instead of being a week or more apart they became days, or even mere hours. The decor is nice and warming, as they've picked a good outdoorsy theme - one of kayaking and skiing. Tables are large, outlets are evenly distributed making it a good study\/meeting place. The bathrooms have been painted with chalkboard paint, making them chalkboards that provide easy distractions while in there. The wifi is free and fast, but sometime 'barfs' so you have to restart your browser. \n\nKayak's location is great, right on the way to Crossroads, which how it easily become dubbed \"campus's westend\" after opening my freshman year (you know, 5ish years ago). The coffee is strong. The food is good, but over priced. (The mocha chip muffin = heaven. To bad they weren't made in house.) It wasn't either of those that really turned me off, but more the service. Yes the people are nice, and learn your name and your order, but the espresso drinks varied in taste each and every time. So I guess it was more the fluctuation of their products. Sometimes my vanilla latte would be AMAZING, and others I'd throw out before getting back into my car. Same with the blended drinks. And the iced tea. I didn't (neither did my friends) understand how so much variation was possible, so we opted for other coffeeshops.  \n\nAnother issue: the parking. They are on WashU property, therefore WashU controls their parking lot, and it's meter based. And you can only put enough time in for ONE hour, which defeats the purpose of going to study. Tip: Avoid all parking tickets, they escalate in price with frequency, starting at $15. WashU parking patrol isn't nice. And no, your school permits don't save you from tickets, I asked. \n\nIt's really not that bad a place. The chocolate waffles almost make me want to return. Maybe I will before I head back to Boston, or they can wait till summer.","name":"Kaldi's Coffee Roasting","address":"270 N Skinker Blvd, Saint Louis, MO"}

It was a first experience for all of us and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We all loved the funky decor and delightful atmosphere of the place and the special, prix fiixe, traditional Thanksgiving dinner was perfect for three adults who just wanted to be together for the holiday with no cooking or cleaning up afterwards for anybody.  Evidently we were not the only ones.  Under The Moon was fully booked for Thanksgiving and I can see why.\n\nThe service was uobtrusive and friendly. There were a variety of choices for the three course Thanksgiving meal (even a vegetarian option for non turkey eaters) and  the desserts  were to die for.  Definitely recommend the Bailey's Irish Creme cheese cake. \n\nThis was one of the most satisfying Thanksgivings I can remember. I will definitely be back and heartily recommend Under the Moon.","name":"Under the Moon Cafe","address":"210 Farnsworth Ave, Bordentown, NJ"}

The owners and the lovely young woman working there are all extremely friendly and hospitable. It really has that neighborhood cafe feel. And the vibe inside is perfect--light and clean feeling during the day, and romantic and cozy in their evening hours with the lights dimmed and candles lit. The decor is SUPER stylish, natural, and charming; I want this to be my kitchen\/dining room! And now that the weather is warmer they've added extra seating in the small area outside the cafe, which is much appreciated!\n\nOk ok, the food:\nEverything I've tried has been great. I LOVE that everything is vegan, pure, and absolutely excellent quality. The passion of these people for nourishing food really shines here. The Incredible Smoothie with peanut butter, maca, and dates really is incredible. We always order one to share, but boyfriend usually has to pry it out of my hands just to get a taste. I think it's $8 or $9 but SO worth it.\n\nThe veggie burger is always a delight--large and loaded with great stuff like avocado, greens, and vegan mayo.\n\nI've had the tempeh reuben twice and lemme tell ya, it's going to be hard to order anything else going forward. It's the perfect mix of flavors--I'm a tad obsessed with the sauerkraut! It comes in a sprouted wrap, so not too heavy or carb-y. The pasta salad on the side is also delicious.\n\nI've also tried their raw pad thai, which is a large sized portion but light and veggie-ful enough that you can eat the whole thing and not feel over-stuffed. The flavor was just a teeny bit blander than I would prefer, but I still enjoyed it.\n\nThe coffee I like very much. Super light, kind of nutty carmel flavor, and not very strong which is a big plus in my book. They also brew their own beer! And it's really good!\n\nTheir prices are quite reasonable considering the quality of ingredients and the care that goes into making everything. You get what you pay for. Main dishes cost around $8-14, juices and drinks between $5-9.\n\nOk, I think that's everything I've got! Overall, awesome place, wonderful atmosphere, good peeps, delicious light healthy plant-based food, and going there just makes you feel great. I wish I could afford to eat here every day.

She even came back after we ordered to tell me that she double checked and it was not safe, so she brought back the menu. Awesome! \nI ordered grouper over coconut rice with pickled carrot\/cucumber salad and it was so delicious. Not a complaint. \nHubby ordered the beef medallions with mashed potatoes and bacon wrapped asparagus. He loved his. And we ordered the Rasta fries for appetizer. \nWe really loved the atmosphere.

He offered to make us something else but there was no way I was going to eat anything else from that kitchen.

I have a dairy allergy, so any restaurant that caters to a healthier audience is incredibly exciting - especially in Nashville. \n\nThe first time we went, I ordered the avo fries and one of the bowls. The bowl was almost tasteless and I honestly feel like I could have made a better one at home. The friends we went with got a rotisserie chicken to share. It took almost 50 minutes for their food to arrive. It was a Sunday night so not many people were even seated. When our table asked the staff about the status of their order, the waiter was quite rude and just said \"well, we make everything fresh so...\" and walked away. If a menu item typically takes longer than others, that should be disclosed for those who aren't wanting to wait a long time. They never got an apology and they said the chicken was underwhelming. \n\nWe tried Lulu again last night because I was hoping it was just what we ordered the first time. I got the other bowl option and decided to add salmon - BIG mistake. It was 8 dollars extra for the smallest piece of salmon I've ever seen. Not worth it at all. Our other friend who came with us got the sliders which were also underwhelming. \n\nThis place has a lot of potential but ultimately needs a lot of work. Cosmetically it is a gorgeous restaurant but the service is under par and the food does not match up to the high prices. \n\nI am so disappointed, but I will say I am a fan of the free vegan soft serve.

They hang these globe string lights on the ceiling of the restaurant. Gives the restaurant an almost romantic feel! Great for dates or grabbing some drinks and socializing with family\/friends! \n\nDue to COVID the restaurant has implemented some changes to their service.

One of my favourite items on their menu! All my friends loved it too. \n\nThe kimchi and stew are spicy. Both seasoned with some sort of kimchi flavouring I believe. Lots of meat in the stew!!

{"id":"jLwKwEht4PU292LAu20Pfw","text":"I spent months walking past the papered windows of The Hex Cafe (the short name for The Hexagon Board Game Cafe), waiting for it to open. Now, I'm sure that makes me sound like someone who spends all his time playing board games, but the truth is that I don't play much at all, but I'd like to play more often, I just lack the time, and the knowledge of what's out there.\n\n5 days after they opened I managed to find the time to sneak over at 10am. The place was rather quiet (AKA no one else there), so I had a chat with Randy, one of the owners of the cafe. We talked about the area of Whyte (East Whyte, which is up-and-coming), and why he opened the cafe, and what he hopes to achieve with the space. It was a good chat, and I vowed to return as a paying customer (I had my toddler with me, and didn't have time to stay). I also got a chance to quickly look at the 400 (four hundred!!!) board games he has to play.\n\nThe location is excellent, and the space inside is really nice. I like the color combination (a blue\/teal accented with white. Stylish white chairs are pulled up to tables; there are 4 tables that sit 4-people each, 3 tables with 2-people each, and (I believe) 4 long tables that can fit 6 people each. The games are stored at the back of the store, with a small (though Randy assured me it would be growing) retail space at the front. I took note of a couple of the prices of the games he's selling, focusing on Settlers of Catan (he had a number of versions of it). I compared it to prices I knew from around town, and he's about 20% cheaper than the other places (Chapters, River City Games).\n\nA few days later I found myself on Whyte at 9am with 20 mins to kill, so I stopped in to see Randy and pick up a quick snack. They have various sodas (not Coke\/Sprite, but fancier stuff), as well as coffee, tea, and various sweets. I grabbed an orange juice and a cinnamon bun and chatted with Randy for a bit because it was slow. If you want a quiet time to go and learn a game, early mornings would be the best time, as Randy said it doesn't really pick up until around noon. We walked by last night (a Friday) a 10pm and the place was PACKED! Every seat was taken, and there was a line of 5 or 6 people at the front, which was really nice to see. Randy also told me he's working on getting a liquor license, and he'll have some food available once that goes through.\n\nI can't wait to find the time to go in and actually play games in the cafe. There are so many to choose from that it may take some time to actually pick one. The cafe charges $2.50\/hour to play the games, with the money going towards buying new games, or fixing ones that need repair. That sounds very reasonable to me! Just don't be one of those people that sits there sipping on water the entire time; the cafe needs to make money selling coffee, tea, sodas, or sweets!","name":"The Hexagon Board Game Cafe","address":"10750 82 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB"}

She took my cellphone number, and promised a text when our table was ready.  We spent the time just walking around the neighborhood, window shopping in the little art studios, and snapping pictures of the beautiful little homes that lined the street.

I like a little vanilla in my lattes (which is how I order it, too - \"slightly sweet\") and I was bummed to not be able to get a house made syrup like they have at so many other local joints.\n-  Only large tables available.

{"id":"DMV4RVEeFWivBAJodDs-cQ","text":"Purchased a groupon with several friends to go to a Belgian beer pairing with a 5 course meal here recently. I will start by saying I am a huge beer enthusiast and know a fair amount on the subject, but I have never been to a dinner like this so I was looking forward to an evening of fun and learning.\nThe night started with a self-guided tour of the house. If you like old historic houses this will definitely be right up your alley. It is a beautiful old home and has a very nice design, some of the modern updates do hurt the look and feel of the building though. Unfortunately this was the nicest part of the evening.\nAfter taking the tour we return to the downstairs for a beer reception. The reception consisted of about ten different beers being opened and approximately 2 ounces poured each time you passed through the line. MAYBE 1\/3 of these beers were Belgian, the staff had no information or opinion on them, and they were served in whatever order they were grabbed which made tasting difficult as no water or bread was provided and going from a double chocolate stout to a blonde ruins your palette. The tasting line wound through the old house with no order, huge bottlenecks, and was served by a staff with no personality or sense of humor.\nAfter spending an hour standing to receive approximately 10 ounces of beer we were called to sit in the dining room and given a run down of the history of the house and encouraged to come to a wine pairing class. We were then told by owner Karen Glass that she didn't care for beer because it tasted terrible and their dinner was thrown together(which showed). The first course comes out and consisted of a piece of bread with cheese on it and was paired with blonde. So far so good, but unfortunately this was the best part of the meal. The beers were served in 2 ounce pours while anybody that requested wine got full pours into a bottomless glass. From the beginning they made it apparent they favored wine and even at a BEER dinner we would still be treated as second class. The second course comes out and it's a brown rice mixed with salad and vinaigrette(was someone drunk in the kitchen?) It was a horrible combination of blandness paired with a cherry ale(the ale was delicious, but again 2 ounces and you're cut off). Time for course three, muscles. The muscles were flavored well, but were served colder than my room temperature salad rice mixture and paired with more of the cherry ale(at least with a second 2 ounce pour I got to try a little more).\nAt this point we discuss leaving, but thanks to terrific company at our table we decided to make the most of it and to stick it out. The fourth course comes out and it includes an overcooked pot roast mush mixed with salad(Really more salad?) and a shot of doppelbock. At this point we try requesting more beers and we're informed that there was wine available if we wanted something else to drink. (Thanks, I thought I paid for a BEER dinner.) And we move on to the fifth and final course of the night(Thank goodness, I can't wait to go get a pint and something that resembles food). Karen informs us that she would have liked to have served waffles(obviously this is the extent of her knowledge when it comes to Belgian food) but instead decided on an overcooked and rock hard butter cake that was no doubt left over from one of her MUCH more sophisticated wine dinners that none of us simpletons would appreciate. It was paired with a shot of raspberry lambic and we were promptly given our checks for taxes and gratuity.\nIn summary this may be a nice place for a wine dinner(or a beer dinner where you'd rather have wine) and you don't care about the quality of food or the friendliness of the staff. For what I paid I could have had a fantastic dinner at any number of restaurants in Indy and spoken with a much more informed waiter regarding my choices in beer without having judgement passed on me.

My favorite is the Club Island or the Milan on tomato basil bread. They make crepes the real way, you can taste the difference. Reminds me of being in France.\nBut the best thing that keeps me coming back again and again are their waffles. I was never crazy about waffles until I tried these authentic liege waffles straight from Belgium. Soft and lusciously chewy inside almost like a cookie dough consistency. l'll never eat those boring, crunchy, cardboard-flavored, counterfeit Belgium waffles anywhere else. And I get it with the fresh strawberries and the speculaas cookie butter on top for a taste sensation. Then I wash it down with their smooth cold brew coffee which somehow magnifies the flavors of the waffle. It's dessert heaven.","name":"Dolce Enigma","address":"14351 N Dale Mabry Hwy, Tampa, FL"}

During the time we were there only 3 tables were occupied.  One elderly couple came in, sat down, then left because they said it was too cold (my friend did have to put her sweater on) and because the menu was not to their liking.  I watched another group of 4 ladies look at the menu outside and then move on.  \n\nThe menu was very small.  I was going to get an interesting salad, but the  salad I thought about was described as orange and fennel, and was $10.99, and to add chicken cost $5.99 more.  That would have been a $17 lunch salad.  I asked the server to explain it and apparently it had no greens in it, just the fruit.  I decided that was not worth the money.  I ordered the crab quesadilla for $15.  When our food came out I could smell the crab.  The quesadilla was a good size and contained just crab, cheese and sweet peppers.  Served with sour cream and salsa.  The menu said it came with rice but I was disappointed that it was just white rice.  I would have expected some kind of Mexican rice.  My friend is a vegetarian and ordered the veggie panini which was also adequate.  She had to remove the broccoli rabe because she said it was too tough to bite.  \n\nBottom line was, we were glad we tried a new place but we both decided we probably would not come back.","name":"Darling Restaurant","address":"4042 W Skippack Pike, Schwenksville, PA"}

I think subconsciously I don't want anyone to know about this Old City gem because they do not take reservations and I've been fairly lucky getting a table the several times I went.\n\nI highly recommend the grilled octopus as a starter. The perfectly grilled and tender octopus is served over a bed of fresh greens with capers and a light vinaigrette. They usually have a variant of this such as cuttlefish or squid. Although these are not regular menu items I have been fortunate to have these presented as specials almost every time.\n\nThe Rigatoni Toto is one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. Remarkably cooked rigatoni (must be house made) in a pink vodka sauce with prosciutto and shallots that tastes like it has been reduced in a veal stock. I would shy away from the Chicken Sorrentina, although good, I believe they have this on the menu to placate those who are looking for Chicken Parmigianino...why have ordinary when Radicchio has extraordinary.\n\nThe wait staff is courteous and accommodating and the Maitre d' Mario has always treated me like a welcome friend.

I've driven past it (usually at light speed and yelling at a Nashville driver) many times but never thought to venture up the hill and see what's there. So, *this* is Fort Houston? Good to know after so long. \n\nIf you're not like me and knew where Fort Houston was, The Loading Dock may come as a surprise. Actually, it may come as a surprise anyway as it looks to be a fairly new coffee addition to the Fort Houston work\/art space. As a concept and a business, it makes perfect sense. I hope, as words grows, more people have the chance to frequent the space (although I was pretty impressed by the constant stream of traffic I witnessed).\n\nThe walls are white and adorned with art. The majority of the tables are wood four tops but there is some quirky, comfortable seating by the door\/window. Once you get settled, make your way to the counter and gets to eating\/drinking. The menu isn't too terribly huge but there's enough variety to satisfy most any consumer. They even have gluten-free bread which put the sandwich options in play! Unfortunately, the delicious-looking sweets were off limits. \n\nI need to fully recognize that I am not a coffee man. I'll drink it if that's the only option but I prefer tea and should stick to it. I ordered a brown sugar cinnamon latte and it came out piping hot and nicely flavored. BUT I also ordered an avocado toast (I can never get these things due to the whole gluten-free PITA) and the tastes did NOT go well together. This is not one's fault but my own. Before the barista gave me a well-earned and very gracious side-eye, I was about to order a grilled cheese with flavored coffee. Yeah, I see it now, too. Needing to fix my drink choice, I went with a 'Mexican Coke' and all was well. My toast was delicious: creamy avocado, diced tomatoes, sliced almonds, and everything bagel seasoning -- the secret weapon. Once I corrected the drink choice, everything was coming up Milhouse.\n\nThe space is comfortable. The people are nice. The product is good (I am going to try tea with a flavored shot next time).

Ahi slice was very thin & the circumference of the whole slice was maybe about 5 inches across. Not worth the price.\n\nDuck Cassoulet trio: basically your meat lovers plate. Duck nicely seared, crispy on the outside & juicy meat. I thought it tasted a little gamey. Everything tasted pretty good although too salty for me. It's a lot of meat. Pork cheek tasted a little bit like pork belly. I had pork cheek in France & I don't remember pork cheek tasting that way.\n\nrack of lamb: hubby ordered this. He thought it was alright. He's had better. \n\nthai spicy cocktail: interesting taste. sweet beginning with spicy bite at the end. It got a piece of dried thai chili floating in the martini glass. overpriced\n\nI think I need to stop trying to be a foodie because I just don't get it. I always find the food to be overly salty and overpriced for what I get. I think I'm going to stick to my hole-in-the wall\/food truck\/mom & pop\/home cooking - style foods. \n\nI wouldn't mind trying the cafe next time for some flatbread & wine.","name":"Wine Cask","address":"813 Anacapa St, Santa Barbara, CA"}

I have been here for just drinks to sit outside and it was ok once you got past the abysmal service and actually get someone to notice you.  If you are a regular you get great service it seems and a few comps on drinks.  if your not - well not sure why but your lucky to get any service so get a beer bucket otherwise just move on.  \n\nI happened to be hungry, wanted to eat right from work and decided to go there for HH and some appetizers.  I cannot even believe how horrible the food is.  All the appetizers are def. frozen.  The \"famous\" bronzed shrimp were chewy, overcooked and worse than bland - milk and butter do not a cajun cream sauce make! philly cheese steak rolls - the smell of old grease and the drippy greasy texture left it uneatable, clams casino - frozen from a box - enuf said.  wings?  precooked and frozen w\/ bottles bar-b-que sauce.  the salmon dinner - less than fresh.  The manager was very nice, tho the chef (cooks really) need training.\n\nSuffice it to say - if you tried to get me to go back there for free.  I would seriously decline.

I get it, it's a crazy, busy brunch place but when that translates into unpleasant service it's rough. \n\nThe food is good - I've had the avocado toast with basted eggs, which is awesome. I've also had the skillets which are very good.\n\nOn this visit, I got the healthy turkey and added roast mushrooms and it was delicious. They won't let you sub pancakes for toast (even for a surcharge) which is annoying and slightly nonsensical. I asked if they could and the waitress said no - I ordered a pancake anyway, and she didn't give me toast and charged me the full price for the pancake. That's not how that works and some of my hungover, carb-hungry friends would have definitely eaten the extra toast.\n\nThat being said, the granola banana pancake was super yummy and large enough to warrant the $4.95 price tag.\n\nI just wish their service would improve somewhat because grumpy slow service is no fun.","name":"First Watch","address":"8001 Forsyth Blvd, Clayton, MO"}

I asked a question and I was completely blown off when the phone rang. A paying customer in person speaking to you takes precedence over a ringing phone. At the very least, you ask the person you're speaking with in person to hold one moment while you get the phone call. Nope, she ignored me and got on the phone and then didn't regard me again. At $65 a month, I find the monthly fee to be a bit more pricey than most local play rooms. I didn't see the prices posted anywhere which meant I had to interact with the lady at the front desk who didn't seem interested in interacting at all. \n\nThe good: The patrons were lovely and kind. The place space is very well decorated, super cute, clean, spacious, and has ample comfortable seating for parents. there are a lot of different activities to keep kids busy. I was there during the holiday season and there was a station to write letters to Santa and a mailbox to put them in, a very cute touch. there are large cubbies to keep shoes and jackets well organized.

The menu is extensive offering everything from Chorizo Omelets with organic sour cream, to simple yet wholesome avocado toast, to stone cut fresh granola with preservative free yogurt.

Eric had a ton of chocolate chips on top of, as well as within, his pancakes. My beautiful pancakes were light and fluffy and also perfect.

I'm a big breakfast burrito fan, so we each went with a construction burrito where you pick your three favorite add ons. At around $6, this burrito was not only delicious but also a great deal. It was huge, came with salsa on top, and had a tasty filling with hash browns inside. I could barely finish the whole thing by myself, and it was overall fantastic.\n\nOn our second visit, we came on a weekday for lunch. This time, there was no wait and booths available.

Bar was pretty full, assuming people were awaiting their trains.  We ordered our drinks from really happy bartenders and served immediately. Be warned: if you don't have your ID with you, you're not going to be drinking!  Beer selection is pretty good. I had a Sierra Nevada pale ale and my girlfriends got tropical drinks (we went to Cuba Libre prior and They kept the trend going). They reported their drinks to be pretty good. Got our check for about 30 bucks and left to get our train. All we had to do was walk through the restaurant and we were in Jefferson station (the old market east). This really made for a convenient place to go instead of waiting in the station which can be a bit sketchy\/straight up weird at those hours.  I gave it three stars only because of the weird ID thing, the fact that they weren't crowded and also because in comparison to all other bars and restaurants in the city I just couldn't.","name":"Hard Rock Cafe","address":"1113 Market St, Philadelphia, PA"}

I can say, with all due gratefulness, that the Cubano quest has been satisfied.  While doing some business in St Pete a local recommended that I try out Bodega.  I was not impressed with their online menu and web presence, especially when I saw that they were flogging some kind of healthy drink stuff, but I thought \"what the hell\" when Yelp had them as 4.5 stars.  \"What do I have to lose?\" thought I.  Bodega turned out to be this tiny little shack of a place, with some very limited plastic table and chair stuff on the sidewalk in front of the shack .... More like a food truck without the truck part.  But boy oh boy .... The Cubano punched all of my buttons, the black beans were outstanding, and I did like the jicama \"straw\" although it was too spicy for me and I could not finish it.  But overall, this little place is great.  At least on a sunny day.","name":"Bodega","address":"1180 Central Ave, Saint Petersburg, FL"}

Also waited too long to eat. May have been my order choice of scrambled eggs, sausage, hash browns, and toast (which I didn't need). Nothing special and quite salty. Others @ the table got Red Hut Rosti and waffles of which they are allegedly known for, which were average. Will try again and order different selection on next road trip. It was typical diner food.\n\nCoffee was horrid but expect that. It takes effort for these places to make it taste like hot water w a splash of real coffee. \n\nThey advertised using Hormel Food with pride which scared me somewhat. Decided to stay away from any corned beef cum Spam-like order. Sausage may have been a closer cousin that I thought.\n\nWebsite states \"Totally Outrageous Service Since 1959\". They may want to update that announcement. Our server was about as outrageous as a choir boy. He was very polite but sadly nothing outrageous.\n\nThey were quick to get us out, but that seemed to be the way there. It was about 60% capacity around 1pm on a Sunday, and we weren't asked if we wanted anything else after food dropped off. Just received the check and 'see ya later'. \n\nAlso sold merchandise and any place that sells chachkies with their name stamped somewhere needs to step it up enough so potential buyer is proud enough to slap across their chest the name of the establishment and actually buys the product.

Grabbed a tea and coffee and noticed how small this cafe really is.

{"id":"xSXxZ5pnfgLT4H0aCfer_A","text":"I feel that Green Springs Bistro should be marked as \"permanently closed\" and The Kitchen at Green Springs should begin building it's own reputation, because under the new ownership and with the new chef, this restaurant is nothing like it was before. Due to the name not changing on Yelp, this review will take a compare\/contrast perspective. \n\nAmbience: Green Springs Bistro was a beating heart for the local flavor of Safety Harbor. Decorated with local artists' work (from the tables to the walls), featuring music from a local musician, and the amazing food of the previous local chef, this place used to have such an inviting, relaxing atmosphere. All of that, however, is gone with the reopening of The Kitchen at Green Springs. The tables are gone, the music is gone, the artwork on the wall is gone, and the tapas style food is a huge letdown. Normally at tapas restaurants you don't wait 45 minutes for your first dish to come out - which is how long we waited. Tapas is normally a fun, social climate.. which this was not. It was frustrating to wait so long for such a small bite of food. \n\nFood: Before, at Green Springs Bistro, your meal came with a salad and a small taste of the soup of the day - which you could order in a larger size if you wished. The portions were generous and the food was unique and delicious! With items like mushroom ravioli in a cream sauce there were great options for vegetarians as well. You really got a great value for the amount of money you spent. The Kitchen at Green Springs, however, provided tasting size portions for the same prices as before, and the food was barely flavored and cooked poorly. The greek shrimp scampi came with four small, not even jumbo, shrimp and four chips. The shrimp and scallop risotto was so under-seasoned we sent it back to have them add more garlic (I've never had to tell a chef how to season his food). My scallops in the risotto were overcooked - gummy and grey instead of the beautiful translucent color they should be. The options on the menu were also a disappointment. Not only do they not offer vegetarian options anymore, they also went very mainstream with their offerings. I could go to any chain restaurant and order what was on their menu. The Safety Harbor uniqueness and charm is gone. IF the food tasted better, I would consider going back regardless, but the food was so bad. \n\nUnfortunately, we will not return to The Kitchen at Green Springs, and I would save your money and suggest you not bother with this restaurant either. It's sad for us because we ate there at least twice a month and celebrated all of our special events here. We will venture down to Dunedin from now on for delicious food with a great environment.","name":"Green Springs Bistro","address":"156 4th Ave N, Safety Harbor, FL"}

When I mentioned to a friend of mine that I was heading here for Monday brunch, she warned me that the service is terrible. I like to sometimes make my own judgement, and the Yelp pictures of the food told me I had to at least give it a shot.\n\nOne thing that I immediately loved about this place is that they have a parking lot. In this area, that's pretty much unheard of, so they scored a point right there. We got here at about 11:30 and the place was empty except for two other tables of customers. The waitress seated us, gave us menus and immediately took our beverage order. I was impressed by the prices, but I was expecting small portions. How much could you get for only $12?\n\nI decided to get the Cochon d'Lait which was slow\u00ad-roasted pork shoulder au jus served over creamy grits, with sunny-side-up eggs. YOU GUYS. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that this is one of the best brunchy things I have ever had ever. The grits were delicious and the sauce from the pork mixed into the grits to make them even more yummy. The two eggs on top were cooked over-easy, so when you sliced them the gooey part of the yolk mixed into the rest of the dish making for a concoction of amazingness. This dish had so much flavor and there was SO MUCH of it that the $12 price tag felt like a down right steal! I also got a side of bacon, which was cooked to crispy perfection, but honestly the pork and grits was more than enough for me.\n\nI also have to take a second to rave about the iced coffee. Not only is the coffee itself delicious, but they mix real cream (not half and half) into it to give it a nice rich flavor that I enjoyed immensely.\n\nI loved my meal here, and I am making plans to go back sooner rather than later.

I'm definitely more of a chocolate girl and was a little bummed that was pretty much our only choice, but I quickly ate my words (and the cake) because it was amazing!!! Certainly a little pricier, but the slices of cake are huge and well worth it for a treat, and really no different than paying $3.50 for a little cupcake at other places in town. I probably won't be buying a whole cake or pie ($52 yikes!!) because of price, but a slice now and then is the perfect splurge for me.\n\nSo thrilled to have this wonderful addition to the Broad Ripple area!!","name":"The Cake Bake Shop by Gwendolyn Rogers-Broad Ripple Village","address":"6515 Carrollton Ave, Indianapolis, IN"}

My husband and I wanted to try something different and I read that they had gluten free options, so we gave it a shot. \n\nI ordered gluten free pasta with chicken and my husband ordered a calzone.  They made a mistake in his order, but even with the mistake, he thought it was very good.  My pasta and chicken were very tasty.  They offered us a free dessert, due to the problem with his order.  We had the flourless chocolate cake, which was amazing.  \n\nIn addition to the good food, they have live music, and believe it or not, it wasn't country music!!  The performers who sang the jazz covers were very good, and not too loud, making it possible to carry on a conversation during your meal.  \n\nAll in all, it was a great experience and we are looking forward to going again.

Not gonna lie. \n\nCame here after July 4 on a friday afternoon and the place was packed with a 40 minute wait. It's a huge place though with two floors. My friends and I were a bit in a rush so we decided to get the TAKE OUT, which was an amazing idea, though clearly not many customers exploited this option because we were the only ones ordering there. However, there was absolutely no wait and the food came out in less than ten minutes. I'm not sure if the take out menu differs from sit down menu (it probably does), but they still had good signature items so we were happy with the choices. We were also able to eat by a nice take out area towards the the windows.\n\nFood:\n+ I got the egg sandwich that came with potatoes. Pretty standard sandwich on multigrain toast and scrambled eggs. The potatoes were delicious.\n+ My friend got the barking chihuahua which looked good. The marinara sauce that came with it was spot on.\n+ My friend got the stuffed french toast. Excuse me, but it was LITERALLY THE BEST STUFFED FRENCH TOAST I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE. The stuffing tasted a bit like sweet cream cheese frosting but a million times lighter and fluffier, so naturally I loved it, and the bread was extremely fluffy.\n\nAmbience:\n+Very friendly environment- loud, cheery, and great for groups. Lots of college students. Super nice bathrooms too.\n\nService:\n+We went to the take out area but the she was extremely nice and helpful.

I came with a friend and her baby. Before I start my rant let me just say that it was completely dead. We were the only ones in there and a couple was just finishing their Chinese food meal when we arrived. When we walked in the waiter (older Asian gentleman with glasses) asked if we needed a high chair. We then proceeded to stand around and wait for 10 min while he laughed and joked with the other employees and one of the sushi chefs had to actually bring us the high chair. The waiter then brought us two glasses of tap water without ice and walked away without even asking us if we'd like anything else to drink. I prefer my water with ice and lemon. He didn't come back for the rest of our meal. Again, one of the sushi chefs had to ask me if I would like more water. long story short, the service was completely lousy, we were ignored and our one sushi chef kept asking us what we wanted next when we had had maybe one piece of a roll. Also, we ordered baked mussels and we had to ask 3 times to get them and when we asked the third time out waiter rolled his eyes and scoffed off.

Instead of a review, you can consider this a record for posterity. \n\nI brought my mom and sister here for brunch this Saturday - the weather was gorgeous and we enjoyed the short walk from Rittenhouse. I always think that the Art Museum area is \"far away,\" but it's a surprisingly quick trip! I knew well enough to call ahead to put my name on the list, so by the time we made it there we only had about 5 minutes before our table was ready. Sabrina's has clearly got the art of high volume down - the staff communicates well, the girl in charge of THE LIST knew what was up, and we were soon whisked off to a cute little table. \n\nThe food was good with occasional hints of greatness. The portion sizes are incredible - you could eat your way through one of these plates for a week. We noticed several of our neighbors appeared to be nursing wicked hangovers; this was clearly the right place for them to be. My sister ordered the special pancakes of the day - and was served three GIANT fluffy pancakes topped with pound cake topping, peaches, strawberries, and sunshine (or so it tasted). The pancakes themselves were so good that they would have been perfect alone. We all enjoyed nibbling off her plate. She even shared her side of bacon, which was perfectly cooked - seriously, whether you're a chewy bacon or a crispy bacon person, you will find no complaint with this preparation. It was chewy and crispy and fatty and meaty and salty and embodied the best of bacon-ness. My mom ordered eggs benedict, and thought they were good but could have used some improvement - salt in the water with the spinach (it was a bit bitter), a bit more Hollandaise, and the potatoes needed seasoning. I had a brisket sandwich and the brisket was damn good, and anything served with a fried pickle is a win in my book. I was underwhelmed by the sweet potato fries, but I prefer mine a bit crispier - I know this is a matter of taste and plenty of people prefer them Sabrinas'-style. The powdered sugar is a nice touch!\n\nService was quick, friendly and attentive. They've got a lot of people working weekend mornings to keep things moving, we got to watch some new people getting trained and it's clear that they know how to make sure everyone gets taken care.

It was the perfect haven for a rainy afternoon and it's since become my favorite spot for a late-Sunday lunch and drink to finish off the weekend.\nEach time I've had a different server and have found each of them to be courteous, pleasant and knowledgable about their menu selections. They were happy to give me drink pairing suggestions when I asked for one, and to recommend dessert (you have never had bread pudding until you've had it at the Caribou Cafe!)\nThe first time I went, there was a jazz duo playing and they drew in customer and onlookers. A great addition to the overall experience. Some menu favorites are the salade d'endive, salade de ch\u00e8vre, croque poulet provencal, moules frites... bread pudding, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and fruit melba cr\u00eapes. I have yet to try their prix fixe lunch and dinner menus, but look forward to trying even more menu items. The beer selection is somewhat limited and pricey, and I'm not a wine drinker so this isn't a place I go to try new beers.\nThe decor is lovely - big, bright vintage French advertisements, polished woodwork and ornate lighting. It's a very pleasant place during \"off-peak\" hours since the atmosphere and menu encourage a leisurely pace... reminiscent of someplace less American and more - oh, I don't know - French, perhaps? ;) If you're a jazz fan, find out when they're playing next and go have yourself a merry little escargot.","name":"Caribou Cafe","address":"1126 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA"}

We loved the history behind it, and the food was really good. My father in law is half mexican, and sometimes trying so many mexican restaurants it ends up all tasting the same. But he loved this place because it was very unique in flavors, and offered so many choices. Last time I tried the Two for Tucson lunch special, one corn tamal and a sonoran flat enchilada. That was when I become a fan! At the Ventana location I had the \"G\" Burro elegante style... with green corn tamal, veggies, avocado all in one! A vegetarians dream! You have to try this place, you will not be disappointed. Although there are a ton of Mexican restaurants and a lot of hole in the wall places that are great too, this is a great place if you want really good food reasonably priced, a nice ambiance and a great night out.

I've been to both locations (Carrollwood and South Tampa) and while the sevice left something to be desired in South Tampa, we received nothing less than top-notch at the Carrollwood location.  To be fair, the South Tampa location is brand new and we were seated in the loungey\/couch area in the middle of the restaurant- I think there might have been some miscommunication among staff on who would be assisting us- once we moved to a hightop, we were taken care of greatly.\n\nI've had the opportunity to try a number of items on the menu: meat lollipop, spinach artichoke dip, steak, mashed potatoes, fries, hummus, sangria, calamari frites, chicken, and best of all, the Four Cheese Satchels. Mmmmm! The Four Cheese Satchels are seriously the best menu item and one of my favorite dishes of all time. The sachels are cheese-stuffed pasta that seriously resembles a satchel and mixed with arugula, tomatoes, pancetta, all in a tomato sauce.  It is seriously so flippin' good that I think I'll go back this weekend for a little tastey-taste. \n\nWith our last meal, we tried the Riesling by Washington Hills, recommended by the bartender and since, I've made it a point to find the wine and I have the strong desire to keep it in stock at my house at all times. \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Carmel Cafe and how they work, each party is given an iPad to order off of (sometimes 2 iPads, depending on how large your party is). The Carmel Cafe menu is on there complete with pictures of each dish and suggested wine pairings.  Once you make a selection, you can send the dish to the kitchen.  At the end of your meal, you have the option of paying the check with cash or credit, splitting the bill, leaving a tip, etc.  Everything is done via technology and I loves it! Once you send your menu choice to the kitchen, be prepared to wait a grand total of 5 minutes or less- they are so fast!

Just enough to do the caffeine-kick job in the mornings. I went to every branch of the chains and independent place on my way to work, and eventually gave up. Which wasn't easy, since I had come from a happy latte-a-day habit in Oregon. After consulting the Yelp oracle, I tried my old order at Savaya last week. I have been back every single morning since. Not only is this comparable to connoisseur coffee in the Pacific Northwest, it surpasses the vast majority of it. Artisan-roasted, high-quality beans, subtle flavors, milk without a funk (what is with AZ coffee places and milk-funk!?!?), and water with every last bit of nasty filtered out. Words cannot express how happy I am to have found Savaya, a delicious coffee oasis in the desert.\n\nThere's not much seating inside, so it's not the writer-hang-out sort of coffee shop. But definitely worth stopping on the way to work, or to get a drink for shopping. Once it's not a furnace in this damn state, maybe it will be pleasant to sit outside. I look forward to the day.

If you don't mind a little fish sauce and shrimp paste, the flavor dances in your mouth. Again, ask for a little spicy!\n\nPanang curry: 5\/5 - This is legit yummy! I like it just mild so I can enjoy it's different spices. I refrain from licking my plate just to stay civilized. \n\nTo add to your meal, get their Thai iced tea or Thai iced coffee! Go during their lunch specials 11-3pm, prices are reasonable and they offer the best off their menu. My goal for the rest of this year is to try everything!","name":"Pad Thai","address":"12676 Lamplighter Sq, Saint Louis, MO"}

I don't even love mashed potatoes in general, but they sounded irresistible on the show, so I wanted to try it! So glad I did! My boyfriend took me here for a nice dinner on Saturday night. We made reservations for 9pm, so we got our table right away. It was a little rainy but on a nice night it would be beautiful to sit outside. It does have a very authentic European feel at Parc, which is one of the reasons I'm giving it high marks. But the main reason of course, is the food. It's delicious and yes, the mashed potatoes lived up to expectations and were super silky and delicious. We started with a cheese plate and some beers - yum. They also gave us lots of bread, but I didn't want to spoil my appetite! I figured I had a pretty nice sized portion coming my way for dinner, and I did. I ordered the roast chicken and it was super moist and flavorful! My bf got the lamb loin and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare and also very tasty. We opted for no dessert because we were totally full. Oh, and this place is not cheap. But well worth it in my opinion.

The menu is pretty extensive for both breakfast, lunch, and desserts so it was really hard for me decide what to get. I finally decided on the french toast which was a good choice! It was not the best french toast I've ever had, but it was pretty solid. I also ordered a cup of their coffee. They had 3 different choices of coffee including Chocolate Raspberry which was AMAZING! I wanted to drink three cups of it. Usually when I get flavored coffee, it usually does not taste like what it's supposed to but with this flavor I could really taste both the chocolate and raspberry. As a result, I really did not need that much sugar to make it taste good. Definitely a plus. \n\nIn addition to the coffee, I really liked the ambiance of this location.

I would definitely advise looking at the menu ahead of time, and having some sort of game plan as you head in. \n\nThey have unique concepts for their pancakes and french toast. Then of course, you could get eggs cooked any which way exists on the culinary planet. \n\nKEY NOTES - LONG LONG LONG LINE TO GET IN, and you cannot make reservations. So get there early to put your name in, and prepare to be patient. SECOND - this jawn is cash only, so don't slip out and have to pay a ridiculous ATM fee to cover the check. \n\nYour best bet here is to get at least both savory and sweet dish. I got a breakfast burrito and Salted Caramel Banana Stuffed French Toast.

I saw a lot of people come in and out of SoHo while I was there, so it is obviously a very popular coffee shop. \n\nI was confused at first because I didn't know that there was a whole other section that contained lots of seating (many tables and chairs) around the corner from the main counter.

The Taiwan-based franchise has come to Edmonton this week and is offering up ten different kinds of bubble teas (or BBT) for their soft opening. Grand opening and a full menu is still up for approval for next week but with the response that I saw on my first two visits, it's sure to be a hit. I'm in love with the CoCo! \n\nLocated in Capital Centre Building on 109th Street and 102nd Avenue, CoCo Fresh Tea and Juice is prime location for both students and workers in the area. The franchise is the largest of its kind, boasting over 2000 locations all around the world. According to their website, over 100 bubble tea orders are rolled out every second. That's a lot of bobas!\n\nFor those who are new to bubble tea, the treat is a Taiwanese tea-based drink. It can be made with a variety of teas (black and green the most common) then shaken with fruit juice or milk, then made with the addition of chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies. Sometimes it is offered with more ice to make a slush or smoothie, or even has a salty \"milk cap\" for a salty-sweet treat. Once made up, it's sealed with a plastic wrap and ready for you to drink with a large straw. Puncturing through that sealed plastic wrap is half the fun!\n\nEdmonton has a few bubble tea houses, Dream Tea House probably the biggest name of them all. My favourite bubble tea places on my travels always have a fairly limited menu (usually offering only a few milk or fruit teas) and offers the choice to adjust sugar and ice content. Bonus if they offer different size cups.\n\nCoCo Fresh Tea and Juice's full menu looks promising: categories of milk tea, fresh tea, fruit tea, yakult (a fermented Japanese probiotic milk), chocolate (whaaaa?), slush\/smoothie, fresh milk, and salty cream. Most drinks are available hot or cold, and in regular or large sizes. You can also add on more toppings like the salty cream to any of the drinks or extra tapioca, coconut jelly, pudding, or red bean. Yum!\n\nSo far, I've had the Bubble Gaga: passion fruit tea with coconut jelly and tapioca. My first was half sugar (50%) with normal ice. Loved that CoCo even offered me a bag to take it home! 50% sweet was still a tad sweet for me, I don't even want to think about what normal sweet would be! My second visit showed me that 30% sugar was the way to go. Joe grabbed the classic Bubble Tea, a mix of black tea, milk, and tapioca. I think we've found our new afternoon coffee spot.\n\nI'm excited to try out the rest of the menu once it's been approved from Taiwan's head office. The Yakult drinks look interesting, a fermented Japanese milk product that I would imagine to be similar to yogurt. Or the Black Tea Latte! So far I'm impressed that CoCo has been able to make the drinks so quickly despite the opening rush. Currently it's a bit hidden behind the construction at Hudson's but it's there!

{"id":"eGwCXZhh9dthWlXrF8uwUQ","text":"Stopped in after hearing great things about this cafe.  I run a local business and thought I would try it out for future catering opportunities.  I ordered the Keto skillet which was good.  My son ordered the chicken and waffles which was not good.  The chicken was tough and the waffle had a weird smoky flavor.  After much pleading  (from me, he didn't want to say anything) he ordered something else and the nice waitress took it away.  He ordered just a plain waffle to replace it.  Much to my surprise we were still charged for the chicken and waffle dish.  I felt that if that was the case we should have been offered to take it home (which we would have declined.  My husband got French toast to go and he said it was ok.  So the way I figured it they needed the 13.00 More than I did.  I tipped the super nice server well and crossed it off my catering list.  Best of luck to this restaurant.  I hope you learn that by saving 13.00 you lost a customer.","name":"Bright Spot Cafe","address":"541 Wellington Square, Exton, PA"}

{"id":"GqVT-AEhcSXVnkFgznFsDA","text":"Man, what a disappointing experience with the Willa Jean restaurant. (Though don't mistake this with the fantastic bakery at the entrance of the restaurant - whose rice krispy treats and chocolate chip cookies are worth the trip alone.)\n\nFirst, I get the sense that this is just a badly managed restaurant. Our party of three arrived on a Tuesday afternoon for food, and were told we'd wait about a half-hour for a table. Not ideal, especially given it was an off-peak hour, but fine. After about 15 minutes, people started leaving and one, two, and three tables started opening up, yet we had to wait another 10 minutes before the tables were bussed and set (and only after we'd asked, \"Any idea if those tables are available?\"). We were getting ready to leave before the hostess said she'd show us to our table. (I've never worked in the restaurant business, but I'm willing to bet it's a first principle to keep tables occupied.)\n\nWe started off with the pimento cheese board which is pretty unexciting and which came with an unappetizing \"shaved country ham\" that was tough with tendons, seemed old, and proved to be rather un-eatable. The cheese came with four saltines, which meant we had to ask for more, which we had to wait for about 10 minutes, only for a plate of saltines to arrive well after our main dishes had been brought out. Not ideal.\n\nOur party ordered the salmon tartine (decent), the BLT (pretty bland), and the fried chicken sandwich. Now, I love any fried chicken, and this sandwich looks handsome, but bite into it and you get.. nothing. You have to pour on salt to get any kind of reasonable taste out of this. Same goes for the chips - golden fried and crispy, but really not a lot going on. Now I'd let the taste slide some if prices were lower, but $13 for a small, mediocre sandwich seems unreasonable in this city.\n\nIt's a beautiful space with a great ambiance, but the lackluster management, high prices, bland food, and other great options in the area make Willa Jean a hard pass for me.

{"id":"biiUrArFB7yHrJjpN1ke5w","text":"Very excited that this place opened up in my neighborhood, I have always liked their food from the Fat Falafel truck. I went to the new restaurant on Ponce de Leon with two other people for dinner, on their third day of being open. \n\nI will say off the bat that this place is great. The food is extremely delicious, fresh, and well-prepared, and the portions are very generous. The room decor is very nice as well. A lovely addition to the neighborhood, and I intend to become a regular.\n\nThings to note: The room is small and they only have a few tables.  If you go at peak hours you should be prepared to wait for a table. They have a system worked out for this very well, so it is not a problem logistically (read below for more details about that). Just don't be surprised by a 30+ minute wait.  I only went for dinner so I can't speak to their lunch crowd, but dinner was very busy. But this should not deter you from going to this restaurant! They also will do take-out so you don't have to wait for a table if you don't want to. You should also know they are BYOB but luckily they are next door to a wine store (Swirl) and also to Canseco's grocery, so there are ample options to get wine or beer to drink during your meal. Also, you order your food at the front cashier\/host station and then a waitperson brings you your food. This is not 100% obvious when you come in.\n\nPros: \n- The design of the room is very clean and nice. As other people mention here, each table has drawers in it where all the silverware and napkins are kept, which is a really sweet touch. Even the plates and bowls are like pottery and nicely shaped.\n- THE FOOD IS GREAT. Everything we ate was really good, super fresh: \n* The kale salad with squid is REALLY GOOD. The large portion is huge and could be a whole meal.\n* The lamb platter was my favorite. The lamb is spiced with really succulent spices and seasonings and is nice and tender. \n* Their \"pita\" bread appears to be made in-house and was excellent.\n* The falafel platter came with tons of good falafel, a couple of different sauces, and hummus and babaganoush. It also came with a really good salad of julienne carrots and beets in a lemony dressing. (The only thing we ate that wasn't 100% spectacular was the hummus and baba which could have been a little more flavorful. But they got the texture right and they were so busy that night it's possible they may have been running out and had to whip up a quick batch. I am giving them the benefit of the doubt on the hummus and baba, it being their third night in business.)\n* All the salads that came with the platters were great -- fresh and simple. The lamb platter came with a radish salad that I loved too.\n* Crazy generous portions for the price.  It's kind of amazing they can charge those prices and put that much food on the plates!\n- The people that own and work there are very sweet and excited about everything.  I am happy to support these young new restauranteurs.\n- One of the best things is they have an app where you give them your cell number and they text you when your table is ready! The room is very small with only a few tables, so this was great because it was crowded and we did have to wait about 30 minutes for our table. The cell phone thing makes it possible to go next door to Swirl and have a glass of wine while you're waiting, or even to go home if you live close by!  What a great idea.\n-They are obviously going to be very popular, and it was their third night open and they were SLAMMED. As I said, it is a very small restaurant with about 5 tables plus a small counter, so it fills up quickly.  However the staff were very friendly and nice and handled the situation well. And even though we did have to wait for about 30 minutes for our table, once we sat down the service was fast and pleasant, and our food came out VERY quickly.

While the lack of signage can be problematic, once you find this little gem you will be happy you came and will be yearning to return to try their other menu items.\n\nThe food: We ended up ordering a variety of appetizers and sharing their burger.  I am a critic of brussels sprouts and there is no doubt their brussels sprouts with duck sausage were one of the best I ever had.  The bacon fried oysters were delicious as was the whipped goat & brie cheese and the fried pickles.  My wife was practically licking the bowl the cheese was served in...she could not get enough of it.  The beets were very good.  The truffle burger was outstanding and cannot wait to head back in a couple of weeks to try the duck and chuck burger with my burger crew.  The only area where they fell short was dessert which was very average.\n\nThe service: the night we were there the restaurant was 2\/3's full and the service was excellent.  They were very attentive throughout the meal. I am hopeful as they become busier that they will be able to maintain these same service levels.\n\nHungry Bear is now in our dinner rotation, burger rotation and soon to be in our breakfast\/brunch rotation which we have heard from others is great.","name":"Hungry Bear Cafe","address":"429 S Bethlehem Pike, Fort Washington, PA"}

After visiting Voodoo Donuts in PDX, I was convinced there wasn't going to be another doughnut shop I would eat at again until I went back to Portland for another visit. Following my wife and I visiting Guru twice this weekend, I can truly say a bit of that Portland magic found its way over to Boise - and you should make an attempt to go over to Guru and see what I am attempting to convey.\n\nTheir staff is friendlier than most Boise places I've frequented, with the atmosphere and style being what sets 10th and Main apart from eateries even a couple streets over. You may not see a surplus of selection to choose from, like Voodoo, yet what you *will* see is the whimsy and fun and care Guru puts into their themed (and non-themed) doughnuts - which makes this place memorable. \n\nIf you don't elect to stay and enjoy the scenery and seating area, be assured you can park on the street for free - but make sure it's less than 20mins, as you will receive a ticket for any longer amount of time. There's a parking lot behind Guru charging $2 for a period of 0-2 hours, which is more than enough time to enjoy your beverage and pastry of choice with some time left over to roam around for a little bit afterwards if you so choose.\n\nShould there be anything negative to say, I must mention and warn others to stay away from Guru's green tea matcha latte; because unless you want your friend or significant other turning into a matcha addict like my wife has since this past weekend, you might want to order something (anything) else.","name":"Guru Donuts","address":"928 W Main St, St  100, Boise, ID"}

If you enter your phone number, you will accrue points each time you come here, and you'll also get email offers for discounts, specials, and free toppings\/upgrades.\n\nIf you're here for the first time, I would highly recommend my favorite: Thai Milk Tea with Boba at 80% sugar and light ice.

So what's the problem you say? Success has bred arrogance... the service is unattentive and assumptive.\nSo I've been asked to extrapolate...\nI walked into the Campbell Avenue location at 7:10 a.m.. It's a fairly large restaurant with a good deal of seating inside and out and it was almost empty. The maitre d asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar or outside. This is something I hate when I walk in a single diner. It's very inconsiderate and when the restaurant is empty, unnecessary. I said outside and as soon as we got outside he pointed to a row of unattractive tables along the wall. I said no and chose a four-top near the entrance to the patio. He did ask me what I wanted to drink I said water and coffee.\nHe came back to take my order about 10 minutes later, no water or coffee. He left and returned in another 10 minutes and said here's your coffee and then immediately after putting the coffee cup down on the table he put my order down.\nIn other words he couldn't be bothered to bring me coffee until my order was ready.\n\nAll this amounts to a restaurant which as I said is much more interested in Turning Tables than enhancing dining experiences.","name":"Baja Cafe","address":"7002 E Broadway Blvd, Tucson, AZ"}

The place had the feel of a hidden spot known to locals and kept private for fear of being overrun by food tourists.  Its in an industrial area of Main St. \nFirst thing I noticed about the menu was the presence of pork roll.  Definitely a good sign for a place that serves breakfast all day.  I ordered the kielbasa sandwich special.  The waiter asked if I wanted peppers, onions, mustard, or anything else.  I was happy he did.  I probably would have only put mustard on it but the sweet and hot peppers definitely added to my enjoyment of the final product.  It was a flavorful, spicy, hearty sandwich which surprisingly did not give me heartburn.  It came with fries that were, from a size perspective, halfway between McD's fries and steak fries.  There was none of that burger king, non-transfat coating which is awful. When cooked properly, these are the perfect fries IMO.  This day, my fries were a tiny bit undercooked in parts but it didn't ruin my experience. \n My friend had a breakfast sandwich with pork roll egg and cheese and said it was \"bangin\".  It looked good.  \nThe people were friendly and competent.  As I mentioned before, I like that the waiter suggested toppings (whether it was his idea or not).  I also liked that they had a few sandwich combos on the menu instead of telling me what they have and making me figure it out.

Our friends suggested it for a last minute dinner idea, and once again, it was an incredible experience.  It's far better than any of the American-ized Chinese food, very fresh, creative, and delicious.  The service is out-of-this-world friendly.  We decided to share several dishes.  The egg rolls were crisp and succulent.  The potstickers have amazing texture and flavor.  We had pea shoots sauteed in oil and garlic, they tasted like summer.  The Mongolian Beef was once again fabulous.  The five spice fried fish was unique.  And the spicy chicken wings had a flavor that was worth digging through the bones for.  \n\nThis is my favorite Chinese food in Reno.

I love escargot, but Parc took their snails to the next level. First, the presentation - The escargot and accompanying garlic butter came in a miniature Dutch oven dish. This meant that all of the snails were moist instead of drying out in the shallow indentations on a typical snail plate. It also meant that there was plenty of garlic butter for dipping toast points into. Yum! Finally, Parc added mushrooms, and these were delicious. The escargot at Parc easily made my Best Thing I Ever Ate list.\n\nOur main courses were good. I ordered the Steak Frites. While I loved the super thin buttery fries, I wasn't as enamored by the steak. It had the slightest livery aftertaste. \n\nI liked my husband's Steak au Poivre better. It had a delicious pepper crust, and a rich flavorful sauce. Very traditional, but done with skill.","name":"Parc","address":"227 S 18th St, Philadelphia, PA"}

I usually have my weekday breakfast routine in place but long story short, it was a cold night and my heater unexpectedly stopped working (oof). I was so flustered, I ran out the door in the morning and once I was in my car, realized I totally forgot my morning coffee and to even eat!\n\nSince I was on the road at this point and live pretty close to Barista Del Barrio, I figured this would be as good a time as any to try to it out. Everything about it is pretty great. There's a little food cart where they take and prepare your food, and a couple of tables on a lil patio. The staff were super friendly and nice (always a plus in the am!). I had the breakfast burrito w\/chorizo, egg, potatoes, and cheese and the signature cold brew. Both were terrific. I'm typically not a huge chorizo fan, but this was tasty. And the half-and-half + lechera combo put a different twist on the iced coffee.

It's run by Needler's grocery, and I have to say I'm impressed that they went all in on a proper coffee shop. It's always quiet when I walk by, and I imagine it's a good hideaway if you want some space to get work done. Great for people watching on Mass Ave too.\n\nI bought a medium latte - 16oz for $3.61 is a good price, but the latte was only on par with Starbucks quality. Bonus points for the attempt at latte art in my to-go cup, but the milk had the telltale soap-like foam bubbles from being scalded. My drink was served in two cups to help insulate, but it seemed like a waste of a cup. From what I had heard about their rotation of local bean roasters and from the look of the place, my expectations were let down a little. I think this cafe could be excellent with just a couple simple tweaks, and I would have been happy to pay a little more to get a better latte with higher quality milk and better milk steaming (not scalded). \n\nWith two great coffee shops within a 60sec walk from Lemon's, I would be hard-pressed to choose this cafe over Coat Check or Commissary, even if it means coughing up an extra $1-$1.50.","name":"Lemon\u2019s Bakery Cafe","address":"320 N New Jersey St, Indianapolis, IN"}

Which really turned me off to wanting to try them. So I looked at Tealeaf instead.\n\nHere I was thinking they only did boba, to discover they do so much more! I ordered the Shrimp fried rice, A boba Thai tea, and a B\u00e1hn m\u00ec aka bbq pork sandwich.\n\nPart of the reason for the 4 stars, is while I was waiting for my order, another girl game in. She ordered and suddenly the boy at the register asked her if she had a punch card. He didn't ask me if I had one, nor if I'd wanted one. I was sad because I'd have taken one.\n\nThe food was fast and soon I was out to eat in my car. The  sandwich was phenomenal. It had so much flavor. The meat was delicious and thick with a sticky sweet Chinese bbq sauce going on that was to die for. It had shredded carrots, cucumber, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro on a super fresh and warm baguette. \n\nThe other reason for the four stars...the fried rice was terrible. I was so sad to see there were no veggies. Only onions that weren't cooked enough for me which was a turn off, and a few shrimp that seemed to be added on after. It was literally rice, egg and onion with a few shrimp. Didn't seem to have enough soy sauce. No bean sprouts, or peas, or carrots or anything. I was so unimpressed I didn't even eat it. \n\nThe Thai Tea with boba was good. The boba were cooked well, and it was pretty standard. I'll try the brown sugar one next time.\n\nBesides the terrible rice, I'd definitely try their food again, and try other things.

Amazing how many restaurants can screw up a Caesar Salad...but they can.  Ordered half portion salad requesting light dressing, well tossed and it was perfect.  The Julia Child Sole Meuni\u00e8re melted in my mouth and the smoked gouda grits and creamed spinach were the perfect sides, I chose for this entree. They had no problem with me substituting!

Previously we've tried their offerings at a beer\/donut pairing at Perennial Artisan Ales and liked their products.\n\nI picked up a mixed dozen, getting half of their 'creations' and half traditional.  They were definitely tasty, moist and flavorful...but not 'out there' enough for the way it's been hyped.  They were also a little on the small side.\n\nMy only gripe about this, is that all the 'creations' had the same white or chocolate cake, with their 'strange' toppings.  For expanse, the Bart's Revenge, which was topped with butterfinger bits, was good however the cake of the donut was just plain ol chocolate.  Now if they would've mixed butterfinger bits into the donut batter, that would have been strange and delicious!\n\nThat being said, everything was moist, tasty, flavorful and fresh.

Not sure why, but I expected it to be a bit larger w\/ more of a selection. \n\nGuys inside were friendly\/funny and let us sample a \"bbq-powdered donut hole\" which tasted exactly like you think it would - terrible.  Cool that they experiment though.\n\nEnded up getting what I think was called the \"creative dozen\", which is a dozen of their specialty $2 donuts.  Was surprised that the $20 in my hand wasn't enough to buy a dozen smallish donuts.  Total came to just over $21.  Bringing a couple dozen donuts to the office will put you back over $40, which seems crazy.\n\nThere were 8 or so types of the creative donuts and a handful of more normal donuts.  I was struck by the relative normalness of the donuts.  They were interesting flavors, most of which I have never had, but heath bar, cookies and cream, butterfinger, and gooey butter cake was not exactly what I expected.  I guess I had more of a donut version of Jilly's in mind.\n\nI tried three different kinds, and none really did it for me.  They certainly were not bad, but they were not even close to good enough to justify the price.  Gf did say that the Heath and Samoa donuts were pretty good, but she didn't care much for the Butterfinger.  I tried the cookies and cream, the gooey butter cake, and another is apparently too forgettable for me to recall.  None were better than your average donut.\n\nNot sure if I will be back anytime soon, particularly when I live one minute from World's Fair Donuts.

The restaurant is accessible and staff are attentive, friendly, and hard-working.\n\nBut much of the food was a let down. We shared an appetizer of onion rings. These were good but blazing hot. Five minutes later they were still so hot we could barely bite into them. They came with BBQ sauce and I think ranch dressing. If you dipped the rings they were tolerable to eat, but if you didn't, you'd have to wait some time in order to not burn your mouth.\n\nI had the three-choice BBQ with beef brisket, chicken, and pork ribs. My two sides were BBQ beans and mac and cheese. (Curiously, corn was not a choice. It's usually a staple at BBQ restaurants.) \n\nAll three meats were cooked terrifically. The brisket was moist and tender. I assumed I would get dark chicken meat (and it's what I wanted), but it was chicken breast instead. But it was juicy and cooked all the way through. The meat did not fall off the ribs but they were tender.\n\nThe problem was the lack of flavor. The brisket was bland. The BBQ sauce didn't add much. The ribs weren't much better. The best of the lot was the chicken. (I find the chicken often ends up being my favorite; it seems to be more impervious to problems.) Also curiously, while they had all kinds of sauces and jellies and other things on the table, they did not have BBQ sauce. I had to ask for it but it didn't help much with the lack of flavor.\n\nEven butter couldn't help the cornbread. While not dry, it was certainly not moist. It also lacked sweetness. My friend tried to remedy this by using honey. I ended up leaving most of it.\n\nOne friend liked her ribs, but my other friend wasn't as keen on his pulled pork sandwich.\n\nMaybe it's an issue of their not being able to keep up because of volume - too many people, gotta get the food out and turn over tables.

But if you're looking for good service- this is NOT the place!\n1 of my friends decided to try 1 of their specialty drinks- I know you don't hear this complaint much but it had too much alcohol- WAY TOO MUCH! That no one at the table could drink it- she drank maybe 10% of this $10 drink & asked the bartender if he would please give her a wine or beer instead b\/c no one at our table could drink the other. He said no, they couldn't do that but gave her a ginger ale to try to cut the taste- who does that!?\nAnd our waitress- Amanda- nearly ruined our night. For some reason, right from the onset she had a chip on her shoulder- like she was bothered to have another table.

I politely told them we would need a regular table in which they obliged.\n\nWe ordered coffee, juice and they brought water (which was room temperature at best).  We then ordered donuts to start with for the table.  I ordered a special Mexibenedict, my husband chicken livers and we ordered pancakes to share (don't judge us, we were hungry).  \n\nThe donuts were great, although they dropped them off with no plates, so we had to eat piping hot donuts off the table...yum.\n\nAfter about an hour of waiting, we stopped the waitress and she told us our food we be out soon.

{"id":"dPFIjfGl3kVEyud9co8Ecg","text":"I'm giving XIX 2.5 stars...\n\nMy experience was average to say the least for a restaurant that seems to pride itself on being high class. I wasn't reassured after hearing other patrons comment as they left \"this service was the worst I've ever experienced.\" Unfortunately, the service was poor. Our waitress didn't know the menu and couldn't tell us anything about anything without first reviewing the menu herself for the brief description included as if we hadn't already taken that route. My date, being a vegetarian, asked what vegetarian meals were available...her response \"a crab salad without the crab\" soooo a salad. The waiting staff needs more training.\n\nThe saving grace (and the only reason this doesn't get 1 star) was what appeared to be a floor manager who seemed to walk the floor checking on everyone. He ended up taking our entr\u00e9e order because our waitress had dissapeared. I believe she was actually at our table 2-3 times throughout the entire dinner service. It wasn't as if the place was packed at all when we were seated. The larger crowds did not filter in until we were leaving. \n\nThe kitchen did however get food out at an above average rate and was probably the most consistent aspect of the service.  \n\nThe selections are a bit pricey but the food was really good. I will always give credit where credit is due....\n\nThey don't tell you this but there is a 20% gratuity added to your bill AFTER they bring you the check. I had to learn the hard way by looking over my bank statement and comparing that to the bill itself to figure why it had shot up. \n\nThe balcony is closed for the season so anyone who had hoped to get outside to enjoy the view will have to wait until the weather breaks. \n\nThe ambiance is a perk that we really enjoyed. The music was a bit outdated but the views, even on a cloudy rainy night, we still beautiful. \n\nOverall I don't think I'll be coming back to XIX again. It wasn't the most horrible experience but when you pay the money you do here you don't expect subpar service at any level. This review would probably warrant 3 stars at most places at the very least however I can't justify that high of a rating no matter how fast the food came out or how good the food was.

Neither slice could be consumed in one sitting.  The chocolate mousse was dense and rich tasting with a very flavorful crust.

I had high hopes for the 5 Out Of 5 and while it didn't totally deliver it was still pretty good. Perfect Hole in One however, was a delicious tropical IPA. The beers are well considered and obviously made with love. Prices are reasonable for small-batch craft beer, and they offer a few different glass sizes which is smart.\n\nQuibbles: Growler fill prices seemed high (I was told $30 for the 5 out of 5...really?) and based on what I've seen on Untapp'd I'm not clear on whether prices include a Tired Hands-branded 1L growler....and also I'm not sure I'm down with the \"rules\" for growlers I've seen on FB (no branded growlers from other breweries...really?) but if you're gonna have rules, they should be posted somewhere on the website along with beer\/growler prices, imo.

When we ordered iced coffee, we were told they were out of ice (the \"ice guy\" hadn't come yet) so we could wait for the ice guy and if he didn't come, we could do hot coffee instead. We agreed to that and then were just served hot coffee anyway. They would not cook an egg over hard; fair--chef's prerogative--but disappointing. We ordered two avo toasts and the Everything Nice to split and when the avo toasts came out, they didn't have grilled mushrooms as listed on the board; instead it was black beans, corn, lettuce (??), asparagus stems, and a crema sauce... with about a tablespoon of avocado...and pita bread instead of toast (??). When we asked if we'd maybe gotten the wrong order on accident, we were told they ran out of ingredients and just took it upon themselves to create a new dish and serve it to us anyway without any heads up. (While we were there, the woman to our left was told they were out of bacon only when the rest of her food came out and she had to ask for a refund. The woman to our right was also given the whatever's-in-the-fridge avo toast without being informed of the changes and had to ask for a refund too.) We ate the Everything Nice and the bread was so stale it was almost unchewable. We asked for a refund on the avo toasts and to their credit they agreed, but the woman behind the counter made a big deal about the refund (\"sorry the register's so slow... I NEVER do this\" despite us having witnessed two refunds already) and how customers need to explain dietary restrictions before ordering... (which doesn't help when you don't get the food you ordered, but okay. I mean, it's fine to be out of things. Cross items off the board, explain at the counter that you're running low, suggest a substitution while folks order. It's not okay to create an entirely new dish and serve it without warning and then act shocked when your customers are confused and\/or can't eat the surprise ingredients.)

They have several waitresses who are all hurrying to keep up with their orders.  And every one of them was very friendly and went out of their way to keep their customers happy.\n\nWe went in for take-out, and I was pleased with how quickly our order was prepared. My daughter had the Spanokopita platter, while my wife and I each had the Gyro platter.  They were all very, very good.  I really liked the Greek Salad that came with the platters.  We got some of the Cannolis for dessert, and they were very good.  But their dessert display convinced us that we need to go back for the sweets sometime.

We enjoyed a bottle of Quails Gate, chasselas Pinot Gris Pinot blanc. My advice is don't think, simply indulge. You won't regret it! To eat \nThe Hand held Benni @ $12 had flavourful layers presented on a Portuguese bun. I liked the texture& lightness of the bun combined with the hollandaise sauce and chipotle. YUM YUM.\nJuniper grilled cheese @ $8 ALSO YUM.\nRoasted beet and goat cheese salad @ $9 Fresh & beautifully plated (shown below) I would have liked more beets as the ratio to greens was very light. It may have simply been light this order. Don't let that deter you from ordering the beet salad, it was fun to eat and photograph ! I would request more beets next time. At these very reasonable prices, I would be a-ok with a charge for an extra side! No problem. \n\nthe soup of the day. VERY GOOD.\n\nVerdict : Check it out!

Based on the other reviews, it seems like the food is pretty great so I can't wait until I get to check it out in person and pick up some gifts (if it'll last that long, heh).","name":"Small Batch Kitchen Cafe and Market","address":"711 W Main St, Ste 101, Lansdale, PA"}

Funky decor with a mad men feel and a super welcoming vibe. The staff is overly friendly and the place has an overall great vibe. \n\nSo nice to have Stumptown in the area. The croissant I had was hands down the best one I've ever had in my life. I have no idea how they made this but it was so delicious sweet with honey and perfect crispy -- make sure to try it!\n\nThe Herb Falafel ($10) is very different and a bigger portion then you'd expect. The pickles on it were out of this world mixed with Tarator not to mention their perfectly baked pita wraps. Tried the spiced French fries as a side ($5) big portion but over priced and a LOT of seasoning but still something different and a nice addition to the side. Can't wait to come back and try the hummus platter everyone around me had. \n\nThey are still working on the outside but it looks beautiful with a fireplace and tons of room for the springtime. It might be a little pricey so coffee shop items but the decor and atmosphere make this place top notch... can't really get anything else like this on Frankford.","name":"Suraya","address":"1528 Frankford Ave, Philadelphia, PA"}

And if all the pastries are vegan, they might be vegan too.

I had to go home and eat that fool with a fork and a steak knife. Regardless, the denseness and size became my lunch and it was delicious.

I also get to Dose pretty regularly because it's near my son's daycare and my work. I should be more than satisfied with my coffee shop selection, but none of them have quite hit my sweet spot. Here's my list of coffee shop ideals:\n\n1) Locally roasted coffee (sorry Dose and Barista Parlor)\n2) Not Drew's Brews (just don't love it - sorry Sip and Ugly Mugs)\n3) Option to get individual cuppings in a French Press, Pourover, Chemex, Aeropress, Clever dripper, or something. (Sorry Bongo Java and Portland Brew)\n4) Soothing, homey atmosphere that isn't snotty (sorry Barista Parlor and Portland Brew)\n5) Reasonable (not cheap - I know good coffee is expensive) prices\n6) Decaf options for my second or third cup (sorry Barista Parlor and Dose - decaf espress just won't do for me)\n\nThings I (personally) don't really care about or know anything about:\n1) Coolness (in fact, too much cool is a turnoff)\n2) Espresso drinks - I drink black brewed coffee\n3) Food choices - I'm there for coffee\n4) Really anything but the coffee and the comfort\n\nAll this to say, The Well is my favorite coffee shop in Nashville, which is extremely surprising given its Green Hills location. A huge selection of coffee from Just Love means there's plenty of variety in single origin or blends, whatever your roast preference (as a City roast fan, I think I have 10+ coffees to choose from!). They will make it with a pour over cone, a Chemex, an Aeropress, or a French Press - a wealth of options. I've had the pour over and the Aeropress, and both were executed quite well, creating clean and flavorful cups. \n\nThe tables are large, the wood everywhere inside leads to a comfortable feeling, and there are couches and squishy chairs if you want comfort over utility. The wifi is reasonably fast (I'm posting this review on it!) \n\nAnd prices are reasonable - $2 for 12 oz cups made to order, with refills coming in at just a dollar! That wouldn't be cheap for coffee brewed in a giant pot, but for single-cup brewing it's an amazing deal.\n\nYes, the Baristas are a little slow and unprofessional-seeming, but they know how to make good coffee. Yes, the bathrooms are kind of gross. Yes, the building needs work - there are some leaks in the hallway leading to the bathroom on this rainy day. No, they don't have good food choices. But I, personally, don't care. They hit everything on MY list, which makes them my favorite.

I decided last week that I'd have the family come together to eat breakfast vs pizza for his birthday. Now, when I say family, I mean the ENTIRE family, it's about 25 of us. Realizing that this place doesn't take reservations, I called last week to see if there was anything that could be done to accommodate us. I was told that \"we don't take reservations, but with a party that size, call on Thursday so we can make arrangements\". Cool! Well...I called today (Thursday) and unfortunately it wasn't that easy. It was a pretty sad moment for this am when I was told they would not honor what I was told so I attempted to contact senior leadership. Let me tell ya...this guy (General Manager) was so full of empathy for my situation. He was kind enough to honor what I was told and was taken aback at how the team handled my situation. In my mind this is how customer service SHOULD work! I'm so excited about Saturday and I can't wait to get me some of that \"green juice\"!! \n\nPS...the food is great as I've been here before (shame on me for not reviewing sooner), I'll update my review with pictures on Saturday.","name":"First Watch","address":"271 Indian Lake Blvd, Ste 140, Hendersonville, TN"}

Our menu for February consisted of warm jalapeno cornbread with honey butter, which were melt in your mouth delicious; a small dish of mussels served with toasted croutons in a broth flavored with lime leaves (the bowl of mussels was a little awkward for sharing among four people- who gets to drink the broth that remains after the mussels are gone..?), a cheesy cauliflower casserole, tender glazed spare ribs, a cheese course and to end it all deliciously a plate of hot chocolate donuts with vanilla cream!\n\nThe food was awesome, expertly prepared and attractively presented by the chef in the open kitchen.  Service was attentive and our waitress explained each course and was knowledgeable about the various wines. An optional wine pairing is available for the meal, but we just ordered by the glass.\n\nWhat I think I loved the most about this restaurant was how pleasant the atmosphere was, the tables are not on right top of each other, the room was quiet enough for conversation and to hear the soft jazz music playing in the background, the room was candelit, and overall it felt very comfortable and relaxed, with a casual elegance. \n\nI would highly recommend the Secret Supper and the memory of this meal will stay with me a long time!","name":"Talula's Daily","address":"208 W Washington Square, Philadelphia, PA"}

The corned beef hash is so fresh and delicious. No cans of mystery meat here! The pot roast is cooked in firestone double barrel beer. It has a delicious peppery flavor and the portion size is great. The carrots absorb all the juices from the roast and practically explode with flavor when you bite into them. The bloody marys are solid and one of my favorites in town.  All the other drinks are great too. They do a healthy pour on everything and the prices are very reasonable.  You can also order the full menu from the bar.

When my brother was visiting I knew I had to take him to one our cheaper Italian byos to get the real Philadelphia dining experience. My roommate mentioned Roberto Cafe and was sold. I called around 2pm Saturday for a 7:15pm reservation for 6 people that evening and they were happy to accommodate (gotta love that!).\n\nHighlights from the meal:\nFood arrived very quickly!\nAll the pasta dishes were very authentic (everyone enjoyed their meal)\n\nThings that can be improved:\nThe air conditioning situation (In their defense it was during the middle of heat wave on one of the hottest days of the year, but they only have one ac unit and a ceiling fan for the entire restaurant. We were also right by the door.)\nOur waiter was condescending and patronizing at times\n\nI definitely need to come back when it is nice weather and even try out the patio.

I was tickled, to say the least, to try this heavy on the cucumber and dill version. Delicious! Never fails to fill my tummy without leaving a heavy\/greasy feeling. Pure's menu is full of guilt free options ranging from hefty salads (thumbs up to the spinach pile o' greens topped with all sorts of great toppings like red onion, bacon, basil tomato vinaigrette y muchas mas) to bean wraps.\n\nMy lovely Yelp accomplices brought it to my attention that Pure had just recently went through a renovation. Unfortunately, this was my first visit so I had nothing to compare it to - but I will say it's a great location with a nice open floor plan.

My second was the obnoxious divider they put up to for traffic control. They really need to review the flow for it caused headaches.\n\nLunch was a Turkey on Wheatberry.  The bread was perfectly toasted. The flavors of the turkey and other ingredients came through. The sandwich was 5 stars!  I am not a fan of chips in general so I end up tossing them. Wish they had a healthy side choice.\n\nI had to wait for ice for my water since apparently the ice machine was broken.  No ice machine in the back either.  The manager had to run to the store to get a bag of ice.\n\nI ended the meal with a Chocolate Dipped Peanut Butter Cupcake.  It was too much for one person but that might just be me ;-)  I cut it into halves.  The chocolate dip was stuck to the paper cup so I could either break some chocolate away and toss it or eat some paper.  I chose the former.  It was very rich.  The filling was a mousse that was very rich.  The brownie was nice and soft and fresh.  \n\nWhat was fun was watching the people coming in from two entrances and trying to figure out how to work around the wall without cutting in line.  It was made even more complicated if people stood in front of the desert display.\n\nOverall I was a tad disappointed in this visit.  Too much of a hassle to park, to many difficulties to get to the counter to order food and desert.  The wait staff was good and the place was clean.

Friendly, generous, and is really proud of his product. As he should be -- the lassis are amazing. I had the strawberry and mango lassis, and they were the perfect flavor and texture. He has a ton of other flavors, too -- mint, honey, blueberry, etc.-- so I can already see that I'm going to spend most of my summer trying them all. \n\nAdd to that the juice-- seriously, I might have found a new addiction with the carrot juice.

We took up the entire long bench booth with tables near the window, and we could barely hear her read because of the yelling (and let's face it, that's what it was) going on behind her.

We will be back.","name":"First Watch","address":"2902 W 86th St, Ste 35, Indianapolis, IN"}

I didn't try the breakfasts but they looked pretty basic (eggs, toast). Cute space but I would rather go to cafe du monde for beignets and coffee.","name":"Cafe Beignet on Royal Street","address":"334 Royal St, New Orleans, LA"}

Everything is super fresh and lightly prepared. Meaning nothing was overlooked. The hash browns were crispy and fluffy. And I love the music too. \n\nGreat place.","name":"Baja Cafe","address":"7002 E Broadway Blvd, Tucson, AZ"}

I really wanted the chipotle Benedict or crab Benedict but I ate too much for Father's Day:)","name":"Em J's Cafe","address":"814 Lancaster Ave, Berwyn, PA"}
{"id":"skZtm3RRVPG8INuRTJHEvA","text":"The best shrimp and grits we had during our stay (not surprising as most of the pics on here are of that meal!) and all round quality food with a home cooked feel.... unlike some of the bigger brunch places in the city. Felt slightly healthier and more organic, green, etc than other places we visited too. The juices helped with our recovery from the night before and was refreshing to see granola, fruit and yoghurt on the menu as a lighter option :)","name":"Surrey's Caf\u00e9 & Juice Bar","address":"1418 Magazine St, New Orleans, LA"}
