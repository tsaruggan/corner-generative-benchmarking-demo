# Corner Generative Benchmarking Demo

We can apply [generative benchmarking](https://research.trychroma.com/generative-benchmarking) to evaluate embedding models that power retrieval for Corner's vibe search. Rather than trusting industry benchmark datasets which can be generic, overly clean, or already seen in training, we can synthetically generate queries which are more representative of our real world production data.
