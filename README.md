# Corner Generative Benchmarking Demo

We can apply [generative benchmarking](https://research.trychroma.com/generative-benchmarking) to evaluate embedding models that power retrieval for Corner's vibe search. Rather than trusting industry benchmark datasets which can be generic, overly clean, or already seen in training, we can synthetically generate queries which are more representative of our real world production data.

## 1. Dataset Curation
For this demo, I sourced customer review data from the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/). I extracted reviews for local cafes and took a sample of 1000 data points, large enough to be representative of the distribution.

## 2. Query Generation

### Filter Documents
We provide context and filtering criteria to an aligned LLM judge to identify documents that are most relevant to our retrieval use case and contains sufficient information to generate queries from.

### Generate Queries
We generate queries using gpt-4o the given context and example queries to steer the generation. This golden dataset will be commonly used to evaluate different embedding models.

## 3. Benchmark Experiments
We setup different embedding model providers with Chroma's vector database and then run benchmark evaluations with our golden dataset of queries to gain powerful metrics. Performance is measured over the top k retrieved results:
![benchmark results](/img/benchmark_results.png)

- Recall: Proportion of relevant documents retrieved out of all relevant ones.  
- Precision: Proportion of retrieved documents that are relevant.  
- NDCG: Measures ranking quality by rewarding relevant documents appearing earlier.  
- MAP: Mean average precision across queries, considering both relevance and ranking.

## 4. Compare Results
We can visualize the results and assess relevant metrics that are important for Corner users to make an informed decision about which model provider to use.
